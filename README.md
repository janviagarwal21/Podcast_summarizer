# Podcast_summarizer
Our project, titled "Podcast Summarization Model," was a collaborative effort undertaken as part of our AI 3106: Foundations of NLP course at Ecole Centrale School of Engineering, Hyderabad. Our team, comprised of Harshveer Singh Thind, Srija Reddy K, A. Siddharth Reddy, TanmayiSri V, and Janvi Agarwal, set out to design an innovative solution for summarizing podcasts, integrating advanced technologies in speech recognition and abstractive text summarization.

We chose the podcast summarization problem due to its relevance in light of the increasing popularity of podcasts and the apparent gaps in existing summarization tools. We wanted to explore new avenues and contribute to the development of a more refined solution.

Our approach involved leveraging Speech Recognition APIs and the powerful BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) pre-trained model from Hugging Face. The process included podcast audio segmentation using Pydub, speech-to-text conversion through Google Web Speech API, and summarization with the BART model.

Each team member made distinct contributions to various aspects of the project, such as documentation, data scraping, audio file extraction, and model implementation. This collaborative effort showcased the synergy of our diverse skills in creating a robust podcast summarization model.

In terms of implementation, we utilized Google Colab, Notepad++, and Jupyter Notebook as our primary development environments. The report details the breakdown of our code for audio-to-text conversion, podcast segmentation, and the summarization model.

For evaluation, we employed the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) package to collectively assess the quality of our summarization model. The discussion of ROUGE scores, including precision, recall, and F1 scores, provided valuable insights into how well our system-generated summary aligned with the reference summary.

In conclusion, our project highlighted the strengths and areas for improvement, particularly emphasizing the need for enhancements in capturing bigrams. The appendices include resources such as the Colab Python script and a link to our GitHub repository, facilitating further exploration and understanding of our project.

In summary, our "Podcast Summarization Model" project represents our ambitious and successful endeavor to address a pertinent need in the podcasting domain, showcasing our proficiency in leveraging advanced NLP techniques for practical applications.
